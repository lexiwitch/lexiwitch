Hi, I’m Alexandria, I also go by Aster, you can use whatever.

I'm a (very queer) disabled neurodivergent trans gal based in the misty mountains of Wales.

I like building stuff just to see if I can, and I've been doing that for about 11 years. I've worked in so many different proglangs that I can't remember the names of half of them. Job-wise I worked at Alert Logic, before a sabbatical, after which I worked at [GFSC](https://gfsc.studio) for a year. Currently on another health sabbatical and sometimes I do writeups and mentoring for fellow queer folks.

You can catch me at alexandria@paranoici.org
